Hello! I'm Owen Rummage, a <span id="date"></span> year old systems administrator and software enthusiast with a lifelong passion for technology. Currently, I'm pursuing an Associate of Applied Sciences in Computer Information Technology at Nashville State. I've been fascinated by computers since I was 6 and have been a Linux user since I was 8, which sparked my interest in open-source software and development. 

When I'm not studying or working on projects, I enjoy spending time with the love of my lifeâ€”we've been together for over a year now. Thanks for stopping by my site, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about tech, open-source software, or anything in between!

I am known for a few things, I operate NixLabs (AS216268) an open-source organization that aids in getting servers and resources to open-source projects all around the internet. In my free time, I like to program and build networks. I mainly program in PHP, however I am also proficient in Javascript, GoLang, and Python. I am extremely experienced with Cisco and Arista networking equipment along with protocols such as BGP and OSPF. I have 32u of colocation to operate my and my friend's servers as part of NixLabs, this is where I run all of my services. I have some cool stuf on this site, including a state of the art NFT you can go buy [here](/nft). You can also go read my ramblings on my [blog](/blog).

I have worked at a few companies in the past doing various things from systems administration to software engineering. Most of that can be found on my Linkedin, located [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-rummage-335035245/). Currently, I am employed at a small computer shop locally. My job mainly revolves around fixing desktops and laptops, but occasionally we get an enterprise contracting job where I do network installations or software deployment/configuration. I also do contracting on the side, see below for more details
